# ApiSamples
A playground for playing with APIs, particularly OpenAI.

Current caveats
* There is no build - the code assumes you have installed the openai and dotenv libraries.
* A .env file must be created in the project root containing the openai api key as follows
    OPEN_AI_KEY=_[your key goes here]_
